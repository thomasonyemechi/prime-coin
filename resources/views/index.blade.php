                                            Cryptocurrency is any form of currency that exists virtually or digitally
                                            and
                                            uses cryptography to secure transactions. One of the most secured
                                            technologies
                                            ever created is the blockchain technology which makes it difficult for
                                            hackers
                                            to corrupt. In cryptocurrency, banks are not needed to very transactions or
                                            payment. When you transfer cryptocurrencies, <span class="dot">...</span>
                                            <span class="more">
                                                the transactions are recorded in a public ledger. Cryptocurrency is
                                                stored in digital wallets.

                                                The prices of cryptocurrencies fluctuates because of the influence of
                                                demand and supply which can be further influenced by user sentiments,
                                                media hype and government regulations.

                                                Many cryptocurrencies are promoted and marketed as speculative
                                                investments which attract investors looking to make quick profits. Some
                                                of these investors are less concerned with the long term value of the
                                                cryptocurrency rather they are more focused on short term price
                                                movements which can further skyrocket or plummet the prices of
                                                cryptocurrencies. The critical fact behind the value of a particular
                                                cryptocurrency is if enough people agree it is valuable, the more people
                                                want to own it and buy, the higher the price goes, the more people do
                                                not want to own the coin and sell of, the lower the price goes.

                                                Prime coin is focused on creating a project to solve several user and
                                                technology challenges investors encounter with cryptocurrencies. The
                                                best of profits and crypto gains are experienced by investors and
                                                traders who jump into sustainable projects for the long term and not
                                                just quick gains which drastically affect the market price. The Prime
                                                Strategy requires you to compulsorily hold your assets for a minimum of
                                                1 year before you allowed by the technology to sell. This way the coin
                                                is fortified against user sentiments, panic crypto news, media hype,
                                                government regulation and bitcoin dominance. This tested strategy
                                                ensures only an upward movement in the price of prime coin for the first
                                                twelve months and a steady fluctuation and growth in the price
                                                afterwards. Everyone in this project is compelled to aim towards
                                                appealing long term profits rather than short term gains which creates
                                                market turmoil.

                                                Too many investors globally have been wanting and desiring a Hodl
                                                strategy like this. Patience is key! Most crypto investors posses little
                                                or no experience, skills and ability to play the market and hence are
                                                not well equipped the market volatility and trade assets, only a few
                                                professionals stand the chance of making tangible profits from the
                                                market but the prime strategy makes it easy and convenient for all to
                                                win, amateurs and professionals alike. Generally the Prime hodl strategy
                                                refers to the strategy of preventing community members from selling
                                                their digital assets over a stipulated period to create an overall
                                                steady growth in coin price.

                                            cryptocurrency projects. Promoting crypto projects requires a different set
                                            of language and approach. As the use of cryptocurrencies becomes more

                                                development through airdropping members when they perform simple
                                                publicity tasks. Airdrop means sending coins to community members to
                                                generate excitement, create awareness and attract talents into the
                                                project. This airdrop reward model implies that community members who
                                                invite others to purchase prime coin instantly receives as airdrop 20%
                                                of any amount purchased by those they invited. Therefore anytime prime
                                                coin is purchased, someone get rewarded with instantly withdrawable
                                                prime coin tokens as airdrop. You are not required to make any
                                                investment to qualify for prime rewards(airdrop).

                                                Simply spread the news and get rewarded. In the prime ecosystem,
                                                airdrops are instantly withdrawable or tradable for other assets such as
                                                USDT. 200,000,000 tokens have been kept aside for distribution as
                                                airdrop to community members. This way, the prime coin project recieves
                                                greater support from a wide range of users. This will encourage
                                                community members to get involved and take on more responsibilities thus
                                                a collective contribution in the growth of the coin.

                                                strategy also helps to ascertain the price of primecoin. The total
                                                quantity of prime coins are divided into major blocks and distributed
                                                across minor blocks

                                                The first Major block is half of the total multi-mining quantity which
                                                is 500,000,000 coins (1,000,000,000/2) The next major block contains
                                                half the quantity of the previous major block which is 250,000,000 coins
                                                (500,000,000/2) and it continues this way downwards. So each major block
                                                contains twice the quantity of the next major block. Major block
                                                copmprises of minor blocks, each major blocks contains 5 minor blocks
                                                and each minor block contains one-fifth of the amount of coins that
                                                particular major block contains. The distribution of prime coin to our
                                                community will be carried out according to the minor blocks of each
                                                major block. From the first to the fifth minor block, as the coins
                                                embedded in a major block are exhausted, the prime coin price changes
                                                and distribution continues from the next minor block causing a gradual
                                                decrease in the total coins remaining hence prime coin becomes more
                                                expensive and scarce.
