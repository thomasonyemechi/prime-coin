                                    Cryptocurrency is any form of currency that exists virtually or digitally and
                                    uses cryptography to secure transactions. One of the most secured technologies ever
                                    created is the blockchain technology which makes it difficult for hackers to corrupt.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    In cryptocurrency, banks are not needed to very transactions or payment. When you
                                    transfer
                                    cryptocurrencies, the transactions are recorded in a public ledger. Cryptocurrency is
                                    stored in
                                    digital wallets.

                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The prices of cryptocurrencies fluctuates because of the influence of demand and
                                    supply which can be further influenced by user sentiments, media hype and government
                                    regulations.

                                </p>

                                    Many cryptocurrencies are promoted and marketed as speculative investments which attract
                                    investors looking to make quick profits.

                                    Some of these investors are less concerned with the long term value of the
                                    cryptocurrency rather they are more focused on short term price movements which can
                                    further skyrocket or plummet the prices of cryptocurrencies.

                                    The critical fact behind the value of a particular cryptocurrency is if enough people
                                    agree it is valuable, the more people want to own it and buy, the higher the price goes,
                                    the more people do not want to own the coin and sell of, the lower the price goes.

                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Prime coin is focused on creating a project to solve several user and technology
                                    challenges investors encounter with cryptocurrencies.

                                    The best of profits and crypto gains are experienced by investors and traders who jump
                                    into sustainable projects for the long term and not just quick gains which drastically
                                    affect the market price. The Prime Strategy requires you to compulsorily hold your
                                    assets for a minimum of 1 year before you allowed by the technology to sell. This way
                                    the coin is fortified against user sentiments, panic crypto news, media hype, government
                                    regulation and bitcoin dominance.

                                    This tested strategy ensures only an upward movement in the price of prime coin for the
                                    first twelve months and a steady fluctuation and growth in the price afterwards.

                                    Everyone in this project is compelled to aim towards appealing long term profits rather
                                    than short term gains which creates market turmoil.

                                    Too many investors globally have been wanting and desiring a Hodl strategy like this.
                                    Patience is key!

                                    Most crypto investors posses little or no experience, skills and ability to play the
                                    market and hence are not well equipped the market volatility and trade assets, only a
                                    few professionals stand the chance of making tangible profits from the market but the
                                    prime strategy makes it easy and convenient for all to win, amateurs and professionals
                                    alike.

                                    Generally the Prime hodl strategy refers to the strategy of preventing community members
                                    from selling their digital assets over a stipulated period to create an overall steady
                                    growth in coin price.

                                    Promoting consumer goods like food and clothing is entirely different from
                                    cryptocurrency projects.

                                    Promoting crypto projects requires a different set of language and approach. As the use
                                    of cryptocurrencies becomes more popular, crypto projects need to develop more efficient
                                    reward and promotion strategies to stand out from competitors especially for newly
                                    developed crypto projects.

                                    Instead of spending huge amount in paying crypto influencers and manually manipulating
                                    coin value, we have decided to embrace a more organic route to project and community
                                    development.

                                </p>

                                    The prime reward is a technique to offer incentives for community development through
                                    airdropping members when they perform simple publicity tasks.

                                    Airdrop means sending coins to community members to generate excitement, create
                                    awareness and attract talents into the project.

                                    This airdrop reward model implies that community members who invite others to purchase
                                    prime coin instantly receives as airdrop 20% of any amount purchased by those they
                                    invited.

                                    Therefore anytime prime coin is purchased, someone get rewarded with instantly
                                    withdrawable prime coin tokens as airdrop.

                                    You are not required to make any investment to qualify for prime rewards(airdrop).

                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Simply spread the news and get rewarded. In the prime ecosystem, airdrops are instantly
                                    withdrawable or tradable for other assets such as USDT.

                                    200,000,000 tokens have been kept aside for distribution as airdrop to community
                                    members.

                                    This way, the prime coin project recieves greater support from a wide range of users.
                                    This will encourage community members to get involved and take on more responsibilities
                                    thus a collective contribution in the growth of the coin.

                                    the rewards.

                                    - As an investor, if the total amount of USDT invested in purchasing prime coin is up to
                                    $1000, then all your prime rewards(airdrop) are instantly withdrawable.

                                    - As an investor, if the total amount of USDT invested in purchasing prime coin is not
                                    up to $1000, then 50% of all your prime rewards (airdrop) are instantly withdrawable
                                    while the other 50% is used to purchase more prime coin for you automatically.

                                    This way you accumulate more prime coin while you earn rewards.

                                </p>

                                    The more attention a coin has the more likely it is for purchases to be made globally by
                                    random individuals and organisations, when purchases are made by new community members
                                    who are not invited by old community members, the prime rewards are randomly allocated
                                    to investors with over $1000 worth of primecoin purchased.

                                    Together we can make history

                                    PRIME COIN MAJOR BLOCKS, MINOR BLOCKS & MULTI-MINING

                                    We are simply combining all the key aspects of carrying out an efficient and productive
                                    mining activity. From building a highly effective data center to providing a robust
                                    mining system for our ecosystem.

                                    The blockchain distribute database that maintains a continous growing list of ordered
                                    records called major blocks and these blocks are linked using cryptography.

                                    The total prime coin created is 1,200,000,000 coins, 200,000,000 is exclusively reserved
                                    for prime rewards(airdrop) for members who are interested in spreading the news of prime
                                    coin while 1,000,000,000 coin reserved exclusively for multi-mining. This powerful
                                    strategy also helps to ascertain the price of primecoin. The total quantity of prime
                                    coins are divided into major blocks and distributed across minor blocks


                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The first Major block is half of the total multi-mining quantity which is 500,000,000
                                    coins (1,000,000,000/2)

                                    The next major block contains half the quantity of the previous major block which is
                                    250,000,000 coins (500,000,000/2) and it continues this way downwards. So each major
                                    block contains twice the quantity of the next major block.

                                    Major block copmprises of minor blocks, each major blocks contains 5 minor blocks and
                                    each minor block contains one-fifth of the amount of coins that particular major block
                                    contains.

                                    The distribution of prime coin to our community will be carried out according to the
                                    minor blocks of each major block. From the first to the fifth minor block, as the coins
                                    embedded in a major block are exhausted, the prime coin price changes and distribution
                                    continues from the next minor block causing a gradual decrease in the total coins
                                    remaining hence prime coin becomes more expensive and scarce.

                                    Storing and managing tokens on a blockchain provides greater transparency, accuracy,
                                    integrity than traditional forms of asset accounting and trading. These token protocols
                                    power a variety of projects.
